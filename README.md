# Advanced Algorithms in Competitive Programming – SoS 2025
This repo contains my implementations, templates, and notes from the 8-week Summer of Science project (IIT Bombay) under mentor Nirav Bhattad.

I am learning advanced algorithms and solving problems from Codeforces, CSES, and other CP platforms. This includes:

- Segment Trees
- Graph Algorithms
- FFT, Suffix Structures
- KMP, Mo’s Algorithm
- My chosen advanced topic: [TBD]
